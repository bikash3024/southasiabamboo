			<h1>Welcome to the</br> world Bamboo Day</h1>
			<p>I still remember the first time I encountered African wildlife in their native habitat. I was staying at the Sabi camp in South Africa. We set out on foot at the crack of dawn and even though it was a quarter century ago.I remember that walk with the ranger like it was yesterday. The elephants. The hippos. The lions. And as many times as I've seen Mother Nature at work, I've never lost that initial sense of awe at the power of these amazing creatures. But as I've come to learn, there is also fragility.</p>
			<p>Today is World Wildlife Day and it is an important wake up call for all of us. We need to understand more about what would happen if thousands of species were to go extinct.</p>
			<h3>Look Into Their Eyes.</h3>
			<p>I have also spent quite a bit of time recently in our Museum at the National Geographic Society's headquarters just downstairs from my office. Our current exibit , Photo Ark, continues to take my breath away; it brings a new lens to the fragility of wildlife.</p>
			<p>Since beginning this project in 2005, Joel has traveled around the world and completed portraits of more than 5,000 species, most photographed on either a plain black or white background. No matter its size, each animal is treated with the same amount of attention and respect. The resulting portraits are not just stunningly beautiful, but intimate and moving. Joel has said, "It's the eye contact that moves people. It engages feelings of compassion and a desire to help". As I walked through the exhibit, I too noticed the power of the animals' eyes.</p>
			<p>What Joel is doing is extraordinary, creating portraits of many animals that could be extinct if we are not careful, so that we will be more careful. There are animals that we may have never heard of, like the Okapi, the Axolotl, or the Mandrill. As I walked around the exhibit, one picture in particular caught my attention: the Northern White Rhinocerous. This animal died just one week after Joel's photo was taken. Though three more remain, none are expected to be able to reproduce due to old age. These are the last of their kind.</p>
			<p>The magnitude of the situation is unimaginable. Just last year, poachers slaughtered an estimated 35,000 African elephants, amounting to over 95 elephants killed per day. This year alone, wildlife trafficking is expected to generate approximately $10 billion per year in illegal profits for sophisticated criminal syndicates.</p>
			<p>Whether it's stopping illicit wildlife trafficking or being more aware that there are thousands of animals that could become extinct (thanks to the most extraordinary and unusual Photo Ark exhibit), this World Wildlife Day is a time to take note.</p>

			<h1>Feel the sense <br> of freedom</h1>
			<p>I still remember the first time I encountered African wildlife in their native habitat. I was staying at the Sabi camp in South Africa. We set out on foot at the crack of dawn and even though it was a quarter century ago.I remember that walk with the ranger like it was yesterday. The elephants. The hippos. The lions. And as many times as I've seen Mother Nature at work, I've never lost that initial sense of awe at the power of these amazing creatures. But as I've come to learn, there is also fragility.</p>
